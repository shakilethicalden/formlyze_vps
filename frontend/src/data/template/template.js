It is commonly used by parents, caregivers, or professionals (e.g., therapists, educators) to better understand behavior patterns, identify potential triggers, and develop effective strategies for behavior management. This questionnaire is often used in the context of children with emotional, behavioral, or developmental concerns, including ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, or conduct-related challenges.",

Each subscale score can range from 0 to 10. Higher scores on the Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, and Hyperactivity/Inattention subscales indicate more difficulties, while higher scores on the Peer Relationship Problems and Prosocial Behavior subscales indicate more strengths. The overall SDQ score is calculated by adding the scores of the first four subscales (Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity/Inattention, and Peer Relationship Problems) and can range from 0 to 40. Higher scores on the overall SDQ score indicate more difficulties. Interpretation of the scores is as follows: Subscale scores of 0-4 are considered normal or within the typical range, Subscale scores of 5-6 are considered borderline or at risk, Subscale scores of 7-10 are considered abnormal or high risk. For the overall SDQ score: Scores of 0-14 are considered normal or within the typical range, Scores of 15-19 are considered borderline or at risk, Scores of 20-40 are considered abnormal or high risk. It is important to note that the SDQ is not a diagnostic tool and should be used in conjunction with other assessments and clinical judgment. A high score on the SDQ does not necessarily mean that a child has a disorder or needs treatment, but rather indicates that further evaluation or support may be warranted.",

This test evaluates key traits associated with alexithymia, such as limited emotional awareness, externally oriented thinking, and difficulty distinguishing between emotions and physical sensations. The results can provide valuable insights into emotional processing patterns, helping individuals better understand their emotional functioning and guiding professionals in offering appropriate support and interventions.",

  "description": "The Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a clinician-administered tool used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals diagnosed with mood disorders. It consists of 10 items that evaluate core symptoms of depression such as sadness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, and suicidal thoughts. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 6, based on symptom intensity and impact. The MADRS is widely used in clinical and research settings for evaluating treatment response and tracking changes in depressive symptoms over time.",
